# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

Used an Imdb dataset to train a Logistic Regression model to classify a review as positive or negative, with 87% accuracy

The reviews were tokenized by removing punctuations and prepositions; then lemmatized to the base word

The sentences were converted to vectors using the bag-of-words approach, then fed to the model
